# hex

by [Andrew Barlow](https://github.com/dandrewbarlow)

## Description

Glitch art tool, randomly corrupts the hex code of a provided image, and
outputs a beautifully broken version.

## Usage

Written lazily, as a script more than a full fledged program. If you have `go`
installed, running `make` should create a binary for you in `bin/`.

### Options

```
-c float
   corruption rate (default 0.005)
-i string
   input file
-o string
   output file
```
